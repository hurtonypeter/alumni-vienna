</div>
<p>The MSc UZH ETH in Quantitative Finance is a specialized master degree program jointly offered by the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich. UZH is represented by the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF), which is part of the Faculty of Economics, Business Administration and Information Technology. ETH Zurich is involved through the Department of Mathematics (D-MATH).</p>
<p>Both institutions are of the highest academic standards and have their strong research displayed by excellent results in all major university rankings. UZH  places among the top 60 universities in the world both in the <em>Academic Ranking of World Universities 2014</em> and the <em>QS World University Ranking 2014/2015</em>. The Faculty of Economics, Business Administration and Information Technology has been ranked 4th in Germany, Switzerland and Austria by Handelsblatt in 2013 and 11th in the world by <em>IDEAS</em> in November 2014. ETH Zurich places 19th in the <em>Academic Ranking of World Universities 2014</em>, 13th in the <em>Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2014/2015</em> and 12th in the <em>QS World University Ranking 2014/2015</em>. This makes ETH Zurich the best university in continental Europe and in the whole non-English speaking world! The Department of Mathematics is ranked 14th in the world by the <em>Academic Ranking of World Universities in Mathematics 2014</em> and 9th by <em>QS World University Rankings by Subject 2014 â€“ Mathematics</em>.</p>
<p>The MSc program delivers an advanced education in quantitative finance to a group of 25-30 strictly selected students per year. Prospective students are required to have a good working knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, probability theory and mathematical statistics. On the other hand a thorough knowledge of corporate finance and investment theory prior to starting the program is assumed. Many of our students have already completed a masters degree and some even a PhD prior to joining the program. The rigorous application process and high requirements for prospective students make the student body one of the biggest assets of the program. ZQFA has the ambition to leverage this potential and to build a community around the students and graduates of the program.</p>
<p>The program is centered around the combination of economic theory for finance and mathematical methods for finance. The mathematical tools for this purpose stem mostly from the fields of probability theory, statistics and numerical analysis. After two semesters packed with compulsory and elective coursework, the students finish the program with writing a six-month masters thesis. Many of our students add another semester to undertake an industry internship. Some participants of the program study part-time, while working in the local financial industry.</p>
<p>Graduates of the MSc UZH ETH in Quantitative Finance are able to work as quantitative specialists in diverse areas of the financial services industry, such as risk management, asset management or structured product development. Another major area of employment is the insurance and reinsurance industry. Graduates have also found excellent jobs in M&A groups, private equity, consulting firms and corporate finance departments. Students and recent alumni can benefit from living and studying in Zurich, which according to <em>Global Financial Centers Index</em> is the main financial hub in continental Europe and number seven worldwide.</p>
